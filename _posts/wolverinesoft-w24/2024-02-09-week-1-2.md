> [Insert Studio Team Picture When They Post It]

winter Semester - 2024. I joined WolverineSoft studio as a QA programmer for my first cycle, and was assigned to the Level/Overworld team. My main responsibility is conducting weekly playtests with new volunteers and developing bug fixes for all sections of the game. My project name is project-quest.

Each week, I attend three standups: two meetings with the Programming and Level Team on Sunday, and one meeeting with the QA team on Monday. I recieve Jira tasks 
from both my QA lead and Programming Lead, who works with the Level lead to see what needs to be implemented.
